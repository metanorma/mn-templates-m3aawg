=== Rise of calendar spam

"`Calendar spam`" -- unsolicited, or otherwise unwanted, calendar events and meeting
invitations -- is a recently exploited channel for abuse aimed at users of
calendaring & scheduling systems.

It is a new form of application-specific spam which takes advantage of the application
layer across multiple technologies that spans scheduling, calendaring and messaging
systems.

As is the case with email spam, calendar spam is not only used to deliver unwanted
information, but can also be used for malicious purposes such as phishing attempts
and delivering dangerous payloads.

Because calendar events and meeting invitations are often (but not exclusively)
transported and delivered via email, combatting calendar spam requires awareness,
intervention and integration with email systems and services.
